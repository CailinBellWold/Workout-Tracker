# 18 Nosql: Workout Tracker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CailinBellWold/Team-Profile-Generator?style=plastic)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description 

Create the back-end of a workout tracker using a Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and routes handled via Express. Front-end code was provided.

### Motivation

<!-- * As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress. -->

### Learning Targets
This exercise provided opportunities to test my budding skills with Mongo and Mongoose, and allowed further opportunities to develop pre-existing skills handling routes with Express.js
